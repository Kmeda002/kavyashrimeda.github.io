					<h1>Kavyashri Meda</h1>
					<p> 
						  They say that a dream job is an overlap between what you love to do,<br />
							what you're good at, and what someone will pay you to do. <br/>
							During my professional career, I have worked as Business Analyst <br />
							for various upcoming entrepreneur companies. <br />
							My passion for helping small businesses grow has opened doors to me <br />
							working with Fortune 50 companies like Lionbridge along with prestigious clientele <br />
							such as Google. Now I wish to develop and improve my technical side. <br />
							My collaboration with various NGOs aimed to empower women to <br />
							advance in their dream career by mentoring not just in my country but accross continents. <br />
							As a content creator I have my presence with an podcast available <br />
							on international platforms like iTunes and Spotify along with <br />
							my contemporary vision to offer counselling through tarot readings to <br /> 
							reach wide range of counselees.
